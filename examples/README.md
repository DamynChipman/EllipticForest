# EllipticForest Examples

## Hello

A "Hello World" test that imports the `EllipticForestApp` header, creates the app, checks for `matplotlibcpp`, then ends.

## Poisson

Solves a user defined Poisson problem (implemented by deriving from the base `EllipticForest::EllipticProblemBase` class). Runs a convergence analysis and generates error and timing plots.
