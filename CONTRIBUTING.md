# Contributing Guidelines

## Overview

We encourage contributions to this repository that are intended to improve or expand the code base for scientific developers. Feel free to interact with the developers via GitHub for:

* Features and expansions
* Bug reporting
* Submitting fixes to code or documentation
* Discussing the code and implemented numerical methods

## GitHub

We develop with GitHub and will interact with the community through the GitHub tools (discussions, issues, pull requests, etc.)

## GitFlow Workflow

For development, we use the [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow for adding new features, fixing bugs, and more.

GitFlow encourages a `main` branch that is used for external users to interface with the code, a `develop` branch that is kept up to date and bug free, and `feature` branches where new features and bug fixes are incorporated. To add a feature:

1. Fork the repo
2. Branch off of `develop`
3. Add your contributions
4. Ensure it builds and passes CI tests
5. Issue a pull request

## Code Style

When adding features, be sure to follow the code style implemented in the code.

## License

Any new additions will fall under the open source license associated with this repo.
