# EllipticForest

A Quadtree-Adatpive implementation of the Hierarchical Poincar√©-Steklov (HPS) method for solving elliptic partial differential equations.

## Features

- A flexible implementation for use with different patch solvers
- Ability to solve Laplace's and Poisson's equation (with variable coefficient elliptic forthcoming)

## Usage

See `examples` for usage.

## Installation

`EllipticForest` relies on several external packages for the linear algebra and patch solvers:

    - `p4est` : Library for managing a collection of quadtrees or octrees for adaptive meshes.
    - `petsc` : Scalable linear algebra package for solving PDEs on distributed meshes.
    - `FISHPACK` : A FORTRAN70 code for solving elliptic PDEs on strucutres meshes.
    - `matplotlibcpp` : A C++ wrapper for some `matplotlib` functionality.

Currently, `EllipticForest` requires the user to have most of these installed externally and then point the build script to the user's implementation. This will change in the next release with optional building.

An exmaple configure script looks like the following:
