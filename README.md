# EllipticForest

A Quadtree-Adatpive implementation of the Hierarchical Poincar√©-Steklov (HPS) method for solving elliptic partial differential equations.

## Features

- A flexible implementation for use with different patch solvers
- Ability to solve Laplace's and Poisson's equation (with variable coefficient elliptic forthcoming)

## Usage

See `examples` for usage.

## Installation

`EllipticForest` relies on several external packages for the linear algebra and patch solvers:

    - `p4est` : Library for managing a collection of quadtrees or octrees for adaptive meshes.
    - `petsc` : Scalable linear algebra package for solving PDEs on distributed meshes.
    - `FISHPACK` : A FORTRAN70 code for solving elliptic PDEs on strucutres meshes.
    - `matplotlibcpp` : A C++ wrapper for some `matplotlib` functionality.

The user must have `p4est` already installed to use `EllipticForest`. Optionally, the user can use a pre-installed `petsc`, or allow `EllipticForest` to download and build it's own.

### Installation Examples

Here's an example of a minimum configure script:

```Bash
#!/bin/sh

# HOME : Path to home directory
HOME=/Users/damynchipman

# --=== REQUIRED User Variables ===--
# ELLIPTIC_FOREST : Absolute path to source code for EllipticForest
ELLIPTIC_FOREST=${HOME}/packages/EllipticForest

# P4EST_PATH : Path to p4est install (i.e., ${P4EST_PATH}/include, ${P4EST_PATH}/lib, ...)
P4EST_PATH=${HOME}/packages/p4est/p4est_source_git/build/local

# MPI_PATH : Directory with MPI headers (i.e. ${MPI_PATH}/include)
MPI_PATH=/opt/homebrew
# --=== END User Variables ===--

# --=== Create Build Directory ===--
BUILD_DIR=build-$(git branch --show-current)
mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR}
cd ${BUILD_DIR}

# --=== CMake Configure ===--
cmake ${ELLIPTIC_FOREST} \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpic++ \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc \
    -DMPI_PATH=${MPI_PATH} \
    -DP4EST_PATH=${P4EST_PATH}

echo "Now cd to $(pwd)/${BUILD_DIR} and run make to compile"
```
